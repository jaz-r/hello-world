"Hello World" Repository

Hello everyone! My name is Jazlyn and I am very interested in becoming a data analyst!

Completing the respository tutorial from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Learning how to:
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request

Additional Notes:
- On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
- Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
